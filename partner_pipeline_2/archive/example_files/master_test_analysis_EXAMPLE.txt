DATA QUALITY RESULTS:
- Invalid date formats: Successfully handled with fallback values
- Text in numeric fields: Failed - requires data validation
- Special characters: Successfully processed
- Missing required columns: Failed - pipeline requires minimum data
- Empty datasets: Failed - no data to process
