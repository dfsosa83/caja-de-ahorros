## Comprehensive Nested CV Visualizations

### Dashboard Components Explanation

**Six-Panel Performance Dashboard:**

**Panel 1 - Model Comparison by RMSE:**

- **Purpose:** Primary metric comparison across all algorithms
- **Insight:** Clear hierarchy from Linear Regression (baseline) to XGBoost (best)
- **Business Value:** Justifies investment in complex algorithms

**Panel 2 - RMSE Across CV Folds:**

- **Purpose:** Shows consistency of best model across different data splits
- **Insight:** XGBoost performance stable across all folds
- **Business Value:** Confidence in model reliability

**Panel 3 - Model Comparison by MAE:**

- **Purpose:** Secondary metric validation
- **Insight:** Confirms RMSE rankings with robust error metric
- **Business Value:** Multiple perspectives on model performance

**Panel 4 - Nested CV vs Test Set:**

- **Purpose:** Validates nested CV effectiveness
- **Insight:** Shows realistic performance expectations
- **Business Value:** Honest assessment of production performance

**Panel 5 - Predictions vs Actual:**

- **Purpose:** Visual assessment of prediction quality
- **Insight:** Good correlation with some scatter at extremes
- **Business Value:** Understanding of model limitations

**Panel 6 - Residuals Plot:**

- **Purpose:** Identifies systematic prediction errors
- **Insight:** Random scatter indicates unbiased predictions
- **Business Value:** Confirms model doesn't systematically favor certain income ranges
