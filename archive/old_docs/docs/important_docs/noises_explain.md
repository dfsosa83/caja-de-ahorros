Let me search for documentation about the noise detection and voting system for feature selection in your project.

Great! I found detailed documentation about the noise and voting system. Let me search for more specific information about the feature selection process.

Let me also check if there are any specific notebooks or documentation that explain the implementation details:

Perfect! I found the comprehensive documentation about the noise and voting system. Here's what you have:

## üìö **Documentation Found: Noise and Voting System**

### **Main Documentation File:**

## Feature Selection

We use a noise-based feature selection approach to identify truly informative features:

1. **Generate Noise Features**:
   - Gaussian noise with different standard deviations
   - Uniform noise with different ranges
   - Poisson noise with different lambda values
   - Random walk and sinusoidal noise

2. **Multi-Model Voting System**:
   - Train multiple models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Ridge)
   - Get feature importance from each model
   - Count "votes" for each feature across models

3. **Noise Threshold Selection**:
   - Select features that outperform the best noise feature
   - This creates a natural cutoff point where only features more informative than random noise are kept

## üéØ **Key Documentation Locations:**

### **1. Primary Documentation:**
**File:** `notebooks/README_MODELING_PROCESS.md`
- **Lines 58-76**: Complete explanation of noise-based feature selection
- **Lines 68-72**: Multi-model voting system details
- **Lines 73-75**: Noise threshold selection methodology

### **2. Implementation Examples:**
You can see the **results** of this process in your agent decision files:

**Example from HELV agent:**
````python path=src/scripts/helv_decision_buy.py mode=EXCERPT
#xgboost model
selected_features_names_0 = [
'Volatility', 'Price_Range', 'Body_Size', 'tick_volume', 'volume_lag_5', 'ATR', 'price_change_1', 'Tick_Price_Impact'
]

#lightgbm model
selected_features_names_1 = [
'Price_Range', 'volume_lag_10', 'volume_lag_5', 'ATR', 'price_change_1', 'tick_volume', 'Tick_Price_Impact', 'OBV', 'Body_Size', 'Volatility'
]
````

## üîç **How the System Works:**

### **Noise-Based Feature Selection Process:**

1. **Generate Noise Features**: Create various types of random noise
2. **Train Multiple Models**: Use Random Forest, LightGBM, Ridge regression
3. **Get Feature Importance**: Each model ranks features by importance
4. **Voting System**: Count how many models consider each feature important
5. **Noise Threshold**: Stop selecting features when you hit the first noise feature
6. **Final Selection**: Only keep features that outperform random noise

### **Why This Works:**
- **Prevents Overfitting**: Eliminates features that are no better than random
- **Robust Selection**: Multiple models vote, reducing bias from any single algorithm
- **Natural Cutoff**: The first noise feature provides an objective stopping point

## üìä **Evidence in Your System:**

Looking at your agent files, you can see the **selected features** are relatively short lists (5-10 features), which suggests the noise-based selection is working effectively to eliminate weak features.

**The documentation is comprehensive and explains exactly how your "selecting top features until the first noise feature appears" methodology works!** üéØ

Would you like me to help you find any specific implementation code or create additional documentation about this process?
