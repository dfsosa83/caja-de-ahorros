## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Considerations

### Critical Data Patterns Identified

#### **1. Extreme Low Incomes**
- **Near-zero incomes:** 188 customers (0.66%) with income ‚â§ $10
- **Business Impact:** These may represent data entry errors or special cases
- **Modeling Strategy:** Careful handling to prevent MAPE inflation

#### **2. Income Concentration**
- **40.7% of customers** earn less than $1,000
- **Business Impact:** Large portion of customer base in lower income brackets
- **Modeling Strategy:** Use robust evaluation metrics excluding extreme low incomes

#### **3. Missing Data Patterns**
- **Loan amounts:** High missing rate (91% missing) - indicates not all customers have loans
- **Employment dates:** Some missing values handled with median imputation
- **Business Impact:** Missing patterns contain valuable information

### Data Quality Recommendations

**For Model Evaluation:**
1. **Use "Robust MAPE"** - exclude incomes < $1,000 for realistic error assessment
2. **Stratified validation** - ensure all income segments represented in testing
3. **Segment-specific metrics** - monitor performance across income ranges

**For Business Operations:**
1. **Data validation rules** - flag extreme income values for review
2. **Missing data protocols** - standardize handling of incomplete records
3. **Regular data audits** - monitor income distribution changes over time

## üéØ Success Metrics & Validation

### Model Performance Targets

**Primary Metrics:**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error):** Target < $500 (reasonable prediction error)
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Target < $350 (average prediction deviation)
- **R¬≤ Score:** Target > 0.4 (meaningful variance explanation)
- **Robust MAPE:** Target < 25% (excluding extreme low incomes)

**Metric Interpretation:**
- **RMSE** penalizes large errors more heavily, crucial for identifying problematic predictions
- **MAE** provides intuitive average dollar error, easier for business stakeholders to understand
- **R¬≤ Score** measures how well the model explains income variance compared to simple average
- **Robust MAPE** gives percentage error while excluding extreme low incomes that inflate traditional MAPE

**Segment-Specific Targets:**
- **Low Income (< $500):** Special monitoring for prediction accuracy
- **Middle Income ($500-$5,000):** Primary performance focus
- **High Income (> $5,000):** Outlier detection and handling

### Business Validation Criteria

**Operational Requirements:**
- **Processing Speed:** < 1 second per prediction
- **Data Quality:** Handle 95%+ of real-world data scenarios
- **Interpretability:** Feature importance aligned with business understanding
- **Scalability:** Support batch and real-time prediction scenarios
